# UtilityfulOres

Utilityful Ores is a simple mod for Minecraft that aims to  add ores for resources that usually don't have one and some **extra fun ones**.

***

**_Some of these include_**:
- Graceful Miner's Ore : Gives you some mining equipment, and haste!
- Ender Ore : It's another original ender ore.
- Sharded Shulker Ore : Gives you shulker shards, which you can use to get shulker shells

There are _many_ more, but these are just some highlights!
